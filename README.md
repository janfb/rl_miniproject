This is the code for MHBF reinforcement learning programming project. 

We simulate a rat in a T-maze and use Q-learning to let it learn to behave optimally in stick-throwing game: It starts off at the lower end of the maze and has to visit the pickup-area in the upper right end in order to receive a reward in the upper left end of the maze.
